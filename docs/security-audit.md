# HP-77 security and quality audits

This is a separate deterministic layer; the HP-71 required quality gate is unchanged.
No dependency upgrades, automatic fix PRs, AI calls, deployment or DB access occur.

## Scanners and local reproduction

- Backend: .NET 10 `dotnet package list --project HockeyPlanner.Backend.sln
  --no-restore --vulnerable --include-transitive --format json --output-version 1`
  after restore with `NuGetAudit=true`, `NuGetAuditMode=all`. Syntax verified
  against installed SDK 10.0.400 help. Includes direct and transitive advisories.
- Frontend: `npm audit --package-lock-only --json --ignore-scripts` (npm JSON v2).
  `npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund` installs the exact lock tree;
  `node -e "require('browserslist')()"` detects the actual stale-data warning
  without compiling or modifying package files. HP-77 initial build also confirmed it.
- CodeQL v4: C# / JavaScript-TypeScript, `build-mode: none`, native Security tab.
  C# no-build analysis avoids executing build scripts; generated code and runtime
  behavior are outside that mode's coverage. Existing runtime/security tests remain.
- GitHub first-party secret scanning and push protection are enabled (API confirmed).
  Do not add a second scanner or fetch secret-bearing alert API payloads in CI.

Run in this repository (frontend needs the lock-installed node_modules):

```text
python scripts/quality/security_audit.py --kind frontend
python -m unittest discover -s scripts/quality -p "test_*.py"
```

The wrapper captures raw subprocess output in memory and only writes sanitized
`security-audit/findings.json` and `summary.md`. A failed/malformed/incomplete scan
returns exit 2 and `SCAN_ERROR`; it never means zero vulnerabilities. A completed
scan with new high/critical returns exit 1; other completed scans return 0.
A failure before the wrapper starts fails the Actions job and may have no artifact.
NuGet restore warnings become explicit normalized advisories instead of log noise.
NuGet JSON v1 `problems` is checked before findings; any problem (including warning),
malformed schema or contradictory scan mode fails closed. Real clean projects may
omit `frameworks`, so that shape alone is not treated as an error.

## Format, baseline and failure policy

Each finding has schemaVersion, source, repo, category, severity, fingerprint,
title, package/rule, version, scope, safe advisory reference, status and firstSeen.
Severity is critical/high/medium/low/info (npm moderate maps to medium).
Fingerprint is SHA-256 of repo + source/ecosystem + category + component +
advisory/rule + exact installed version + scope + advisory range/own severity
(where supplied) + effective severity. It never includes a secret value.
NuGet scope includes project basename and framework, independent of checkout path.
Npm validates all five aggregate severity counts against both total and package
records. For concrete advisories, the lock-installed npm `semver` library checks
each installed version against the advisory range with npm audit's options
(`includePrerelease: true`, `loose: true`). No handwritten range implementation or
new dependency/version is introduced. Fingerprints are created only after matching.
Finding severity is the advisory's own severity, never the aggregate package level.
Meta-vulnerability chains must reach a concrete affected package; they do not
create synthetic wrapper/advisory/version records. Unresolved/cyclic-only chains
fail closed. The report deduplicates the concrete leaf identities, even when many
wrappers reach the same leaf. Native npm aggregate package counts remain separate.
Frontend Python tests invoke the real semver helper; the existing `npm ci` step
now precedes those tests in the quality gate. All mandatory checks remain intact.

`.security/baseline.json` is the sanitized **pre-implementation** snapshot at
`0bd5d8c74d392fb987197e0d9273d758f62e5cce`, observed 2026-09-30. Counts: 2 critical, 72 high, 44 medium, 7 low, 1 info.
Review correction: the old frontend count of 249 becomes **126** (125 concrete
advisory/version findings plus Browserslist info). Removed unaffected installed
versions, wrapper copies and aggregate-severity inflation. Raw npm still reports
60 package records (2 critical, 32 high, 15 moderate, 11 low). The corrected
pre-change observation and a fresh npm scan agree on the same unchanged lockfile.
The frontend baseline records the original Git blob's SHA-256 for that lockfile;
no old incorrect fingerprints were retained to make CI green. Backend was
recomputed with the strict parser: all 21 exact fingerprints remain unchanged.

It has exact fingerprints, category, firstSeen, status and rationale. No wildcard
or package-wide acceptance. These are deferred existing risks, not fixed issues.
No baseline is permitted for secrets. The implementation creates no follow-up issues.

- Matching baseline: **KNOWN/BASELINED**, always visible, does not block.
- Unmatched: **NEW**; high/critical fails both PR and scheduled dependency jobs.
- New medium/low/info remains visible and advisory.
- firstSeen is the observed baseline date, not an invented advisory publication date.
  NEW has null firstSeen; the run timestamp is its observation. Missing old
  fingerprints are not reported as active; baseline removal is an explicit review.
- A changed package version, severity, advisory, advisory range or project scope
  creates a new fingerprint. No workflow regenerates or broadens the baseline.
- Baseline edits are security-sensitive code changes requiring HP-76 independent
  review. The initial HP-77 PR uses the proposed pre-change baseline to bootstrap;
  subsequent acceptance needs concrete evidence and rationale, never a blanket fix.

**Native CodeQL policy differs intentionally:** findings live in GitHub's persistent
code-scanning alerts (native dedup and PR annotations), not in the dependency
baseline. The CodeQL job fails on execution/upload failure; its success alone is
NOT proof of no high findings. Native introduced-alert severity enforcement needs
an operator code-scanning rule; no settings are silently changed. Inspect the
initial CodeQL report before approving HP-77. Do not pretend legacy CodeQL findings
were observed locally or accepted into the dependency baseline. GitHub secret
alerts likewise stay native and cannot be accepted through this baseline.

## Workflow and trust

`.github/workflows/security-audit.yml`: PR to develop, push to develop, Monday 07:23 UTC,
workflow_dispatch. PR scans its merge SHA; other events require the develop ref
and explicitly check out develop. The repository guard excludes forks' own schedules.
Develop pushes also establish the native CodeQL base analysis after merge, even
while weekly activation awaits the required operator switch to default=develop. Before that first base
analysis, native PR comparison may be unavailable; inspect the initial full scan.
No `pull_request_target`, environments, repository secrets, SSH, deployment, DB,
commits, settings writes or dependency update steps. Fork PRs get no trusted secrets.
Contents is read-only; only the CodeQL job gets security-events:write for native
SARIF upload. Default GITHUB_TOKEN only. Checkout never persists credentials.
No raw scan logs or raw SARIF are uploaded as generic artifacts. The normalized
metadata artifact expires after seven days. Inspect source only with sanitized
metadata; neither AI nor public reports should ingest secret alert values.

Action audit: first-party actions only, immutable reviewed tag SHAs: checkout v6,
setup-python v6, setup-node v6 / setup-dotnet v5, upload-artifact v4, CodeQL v4.
These use the hosted ubuntu-latest runner; no third-party action or API-key service.
Pins were resolved from the upstream GitHub tag refs on 2026-09-30. Pin updates need
review; existing deployment/validation workflow action dependencies were not changed.

## Observed GitHub settings and operator prerequisites

Read-only authenticated API observation, 2026-09-30, both repos:

- Public; default branch **master**. Secret scanning and push protection enabled.
- CodeQL default setup `not-configured`; therefore the advanced workflow is not a duplicate.
- Dependabot config absent. Automated security updates disabled (no auto-upgrade PRs).
- Dependency graph SBOM and vulnerability-alerts endpoints returned HTTP 404.
  Their actual enablement is **unconfirmed**, not inferred from public visibility.
- Actions enabled, all actions allowed, SHA pin requirement false; default token
  permissions read and PR approval permission false. New actions are pinned anyway.
- Develop protection: strict required check `validation / Frontend quality gate`,
  enforce admins true. No branch protection modifications were performed.

**READY FOR OPERATOR SETTINGS.** These are prerequisites/recommendations, not applied changes:

1. **Selected project design: develop is the canonical development/default branch;
   master remains the production/release branch.** After human review and merge,
   Sergey must perform in each repository: Settings -> General -> Default branch
   -> switch to **develop** -> Update, then verify the setting. This required
   operator action is not performed by the author or by a workflow. With the
   current master default, a develop-only merge does not activate cron/manual
   discovery. No master scheduler workflow or external secret-based scheduler is
   introduced. Once default=develop, schedule receives refs/heads/develop and
   the tested event/ref guard runs the audit; master-ref events are rejected.

   Repository-wide consequences: new PRs default their base to develop; new clones
   initially check out develop; tools without an explicit ref resolve develop.
   Release PRs must explicitly select **master** as their base. The production
   workflow explicitly listening to push master remains unchanged and does not
   start deploying develop because of the default-branch switch.
2. Settings -> Security -> Advanced Security (older UI: Code security and analysis):
   verify Dependency graph and Dependabot alerts; enable if desired/available.
   Keep Dependabot security updates and version-update PRs disabled for HP-77.
   Verify Secret Protection -> Secret scanning and Push protection are enabled;
   Security -> Secret scanning shows native alert status. Do not export values.
3. Code Security -> Code scanning -> confirm advanced CodeQL analysis appears after
   the PR workflow. Do not enable default setup alongside this workflow.
   Security -> Code scanning -> filter branch develop after merge to verify coverage.
   If feature/settings are unavailable, record the UI limitation; do not claim enablement.
4. Optional: Settings -> Rules -> Rulesets -> the existing develop-only rule
   (or a separately reviewed develop rule) -> Require code scanning results ->
   CodeQL -> security alert threshold High or higher. Preserve existing protection;
   do not add duplicate/conflicting rules. This native introduced-alert enforcement
   is distinct from simply requiring the CodeQL execution check.
5. After observing a real run, consider requiring **Deterministic dependency audit**
   in the existing develop protection's required status checks (GitHub Actions).
   Existing required context stays `validation / Frontend quality gate`. Check the
   actual PR check context before selecting; no guessed or fabricated context.
6. After the required default=develop switch, Actions -> Security audit -> Run workflow -> develop.
   Verify both jobs, Job Summary, artifact contents/retention and first weekly run.
   Record the real workflow_dispatch result and first weekly run after the switch.
   Neither activation nor scheduled execution is proven by PR CI.

## AI separation, privacy and rollback

AI is a separate external ChatGPT automation, created by Sergey **after merge**
with connected GitHub + Linear. No OpenAI/Codex API key or AI Action is introduced.
See [backend canonical AI audit contract](https://github.com/tracktorist237/HockeyPlanner.Backend/blob/develop/docs/ai-security-audit.md) for the canonical read-only contract, evidence and dedup rules.
`secret_metadata()` is an operator-side allowlist example with a synthetic GitHub
alert regression test: only alert number/rule are retained; secret, URL, path,
prose and unknown fields are dropped. CI does not call the secret alerts API.
This is a sanitizer test, not a claim that a real secret was uploaded to test GitHub.

Disable: Actions -> Security audit -> menu -> Disable workflow (operator), or
revert only the HP-77 task changes through a reviewed PR. Do not disable HP-71,
change baseline to hide failures, alter production workflows or touch VERSION.
If made required, the operator must coordinate removing just the HP-77 requirement
before disabling it. Disable the future external AI automation separately.
